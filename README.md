## Tech Stack

| Layer         | Tool/Tech                    |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| Data Source   | [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) |
| Data Handling | Python, Pandas               |
| Database      | PostgreSQL (Supabase-hosted) |
| Visualization | Metabase                     |
| Deployment    | Local / Cloud                |

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Data is fetched from the CoinMarketCap API every 10 minutes using a scheduled script.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   Using `pandas`, the raw JSON data is cleaned and structured into tabular form.

3. **Data Storage**  
   Transformed data is pushed into a PostgreSQL database hosted on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

4. **Visualization**  
   Metabase connects to the cloud database to generate dynamic and interactive dashboards that reflect the latest data.
